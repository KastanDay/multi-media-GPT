What\\'s going on this morning with Custom Offsets? Custom Offsets TV? On the YouTube? Back at it again with another episode of From the Inbox, where we answer the questions that you guys sent us in the DMS or drop in the comments on YouTube and Facebook. So I recently was talking to a guy on Instagram, actually a couple people that had really similar questions. They\\'re asking about the differences between lift kits and leveling kits and if a lift kit is going to level their truck. So when it comes to a leveling kit versus a lift kit, it\\'s relatively self-explanatory, but it can get kind of confusing because there are different sizes for leveling kits and that\\'s kind of where some of that confusion comes in. So if you\\'re buying a leveling kit in general that just lifts the front of your truck, there are some out there that sell a lift slash level, and that\\'s gonna give you something for the rear also, but 99.9 percent of the time if you\\'re buying a leveling kit, it\\'s just affecting the front of your truck. And most commonly if you\\'re buying a leveling kit, it\\'s gonna be a spacer that goes on either at the top or the bottom of your strut and that\\'s gonna bring the front of your vehicle up. So trucks from factory come with something called Rake. So if this is the front of your vehicle and this is the rear, naturally the vehicle sits lower in the front so that when you load a trailer, it sits level. Or if you load the bed by installing a leveling kit, what you\\'re doing is bringing up the front of the truck, so it sits level with the rear when you\\'re unloaded. So typically a leveling kit is gonna be two, two-and-a-half or three inches, depends on the truck, and then which kit you buy for the leveling kit. You don\\'t get any extra components like upper control arms unless you add those yourself that aren\\'t kits that come like that. So you have to be careful if you\\'re really stretching the boundaries and you find like a three or three and a half inch leveling kit because you\\'re really gonna be pushing those front end components and causing unneeded stress on the front of your truck. Now when it comes to a lift kit, that\\'s gonna be something that affects both the front of your truck and the rear of your truck. So if you buy a six inch lift kit, typically you\\'re\",\\n      \"top_p\": 0.94,\\n      \"ctx_ppl\": 36.332454681396484,\\n      \"model_name\": \"noisifytext_nov17_2020_medium\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"noisyasr\": \"gonna have either a six inch strut spacer which goes on top of your strut in the front or you\\'ll have the complete replacement strut and that brings the front of your about 6 inches now in that same 6-inch kit in the rear you\\'re probably only only going to get a 4 inch block and again the reason for that is the factory rakes the front has gone up 6 inches and the back has gone up four but because from the factory came with that extra 2 they now sit perfectly level so that\\'s your answer as far as the lift level my trucks now depending on options you can buy I know this is common on like 2500 if you get like a five and a half inch or six and a half inch VDS for example that brings up front up about six and a half inches and then you have the option in the rear to get a four and a half inch flock for a five and a half inch block so if you get that caller block it\\'s gonna bring back some of that factory rake and go up higher in the rear one of the guys that I was talking to an Instagram had a Toyota I think was a Tacoma he went out and measured the distances between the ground and the bottom of his wheel well he said the front was 35 and the rear was 37 so he\\'s got that two inch difference he wanted to know if I buy a three inch level what will happen front and rear and if I buy a three inch lift what will happen in front of them so with the three inch leveling kit if you add that three inches to the 35 inches that he measured that puts you at 38 in front and you still sit at 37 in the rear so you have a little bit of squat now if you were to buy a three inch lift kit that\\'s gonna give you the three in the front you\\'re bringing up to 38 in a one inch block in the rear which also will bring that up to 38 and again now you\\'re sitting level so it\\'s really just simple math if you can kind of follow along with what I\\'m doing there and you can add up you know what your truck is gonna be and just like he did if you go out and measure from the ground to the bottom of your wheel well add on the size of your kit and then you can figure out where you\\'re gonna be sitting at and then\",\\n      \"eos_token\": 50266,\\n      \"cleanasr\": \"You\\'re gonna have either a six inch strut spacer, which goes on top of your strut in the front, or you\\'ll have the complete replacement strut. And that brings the front of your about 6 inches now. In that same 6-inch kit in the rear, you\\'re probably only only going to get a 4 inch block. And again, the reason for that is the factory rakes, the front has gone up 6 inches and the back has gone up four, but because from the factory, came with that extra 2, they now sit perfectly level. So that\\'s your answer as far as the lift level. My trucks now, depending on options you can buy, I know this is common on packages like 2500, if you get like a five and a half inch or six and a half inch VDS, for example, that brings up the front up about six and a half inches. And then you have the option in the rear to get a four and a half inch lift, for a five and a half inch block. So if you get that three inch block, it\\'s gonna bring back some of that factory rake and go up higher in the rear. One of the guys that I was talking to, an Instagram had a Toyota, I think was a Tacoma, he went out and measured the distances between the ground and the bottom of his wheel well. He said the front was 35 and the rear was 37. So he\\'s got that two inch difference. He wanted to know if I buy a three inch level, what will happen front and rear. And if I buy a three inch lift, what will happen in front of them. So with the three inch leveling kit, if you add that three inches to the 35 inches that he measured, that puts you at 38 in front. And you still sit at 37 in the rear. So you have a little bit of squat. Now if you were to buy a three inch lift kit, that\\'s gonna give you the three in the front. You\\'re bringing up to 38 in a one inch block in the rear, which also will bring that up to 38. And again, now you\\'re sitting level. So it\\'s really just simple math, if you can kind of follow along with what I\\'m doing there, and you can add up what your truck is gonna be, and just like he did, if you go out and measure from the ground to the bottom of your wheel well, add on the size of your kit, and then you can figure out where you\\'re gonna be sitting at, and then -\",\\n      \"top_p\": 0.94,\\n      \"ctx_ppl\": 36.5517578125,\\n      \"model_name\": \"noisifytext_nov17_2020_medium\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"noisyasr\": \"in the rear you can do the same thing you can use the just simple math by taking whatever size the block is and adding that to the rear of your truck and that\\'s about where you\\'re gonna sit so that should answer those questions another question that we got was somebody who already had a three inch leveling kit installed on his truck he was wondering if he switches out to a two inch to two and a half inch coil over if that will give him five and a half inches lit the way leveling kits work like I said is that spacer on top of your stock strut assembly so if you switch out to a coil over you should be removing that spacer so the coil over then will give you two and a half inches so in his case he had a three inch wants to replace it with a two two two and a half the spoilers are adjustable so he\\'s actually not increasing any of the front lifts you\\'d be decreasing it by about a half inch inch depending on where he sets the coil over at now you can add a coil over to your leveling kit however it\\'s not recommended because like I said those leveling kits don\\'t come with new control arms or all the other parts you need to correct the angles being your CV angles and your control arm angles because as you go up with the truck you\\'re changing the geometry of your front suspension which causes more stress on those front end components so if you were to try to add a coil over to get on top of your three-inch leveling kits to get about five to five and a half inches of lift you\\'re gonna really stress the front of your truck and we definitely do not recommend stacking lift components that\\'s gonna be something you want to avoid so hopefully that answers your question if you were one of those guys I know I responded directly to you on Instagram and got you guys all figured out but if you had the same question you\\'re just watching these videos hopefully that answers it for you give it another questions Cooper do drop them in the comments I know this was kind of may be confusing to some people because there\\'s a lot of numbers in there but it really is just simple math if you guys need any help with it like I said feel free to drop a comment below or shoot us a message we will do our best to answer your questions or we might make a video on it peace\",\\n      \"eos_token\": 50266,\\n      \"cleanasr\": \"In the rear, you can do the same thing. You can use the - just simple math - by taking whatever size the block is and adding that to the rear of your truck and that\\'s about where you\\'re gonna sit. So that should answer those questions. Another question that we got was somebody who already had a three inch leveling kit installed on his truck. He was wondering if he switches out to a two inch to two and a half inch coil over if that will give him five and a half inches lit the way leveling kits work. Like I said, is that spacer on top of your stock strut assembly. So if you switch out to a coil over, you should be removing that spacer. So the coil over then will give you two and a half inches. So in his case, he had a three inch wants to replace it with a two, two, two and a half. The spoilers are adjustable, so he\\'s actually not increasing any of the front lifts. You\\'d be decreasing it by about a half inch inch depending on where he sets the coil over at. Now you can add a coil over to your leveling kit. However, it\\'s not recommended because like I said, those leveling kits don\\'t come with new control arms or all the other parts you need to correct the angles, being your one angles and your control arm angles because as you go up with the truck, you\\'re changing the geometry of your front suspension which causes more stress on those front end components. So if you were to try to add a coil over to get on top of your three-inch leveling kits to get about five to five and a half inches of lift, you\\'re gonna really stress the front of your truck and we definitely do not recommend stacking lift components. That\\'s gonna be something you want to avoid. So hopefully that answers your question. If you were one of those guys, I know I responded directly to you on Instagram and got you guys all figured out, but if you had the same question, you\\'re just watching these videos. Hopefully that answers it for you. Give it another couple questions and do drop them in the comments. I know this was kind of may be confusing to some people because there\\'s a lot of numbers in there, but it really is just simple math.
